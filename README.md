A created this Python 3 program as I had to go thru a lot of different podcasts and find 
tracks download links. I needed to automate this boring process and save myself time.

1/ Open the podcast URL

2/ Find the text corresponding to the tracklist (my first try with RegEx)

3/ For each song, try to find a zippyshare download link via a simple Google Search( I know that bad, buy music! )

Very basic but it works! (and I m just learning!)
